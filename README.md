# Luke's Sales Tracker

This was a school project I made for a Java class. It's a sales tracker app and far from perfect. It doesn't have form validation at the
moment, but may be added later. However, it is functional and will be helpful to beginners. 

This program uses Swing, Collections, and Files. Components built with GUI Builder.
